# Project 4 WebKit
Simple browser application using WebKit.

Browse through apple.com and hackingwithswift.com using "Open" button in Navigation Bar.

For security reasons, only whitelisted links can be visited. I used an array containing the URL of the websites to whitelist. Only links containing these URLs can be accessed(subdomains can be accessed too).

Navigation bar has loading bar, refresh button, URL title and Open button for browsing.
